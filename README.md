# Songs For Later

A MEAN stack app that I built, utilizing the itunes and tastekid APIs (will later use spotify instead of tastekid in the future)

# Getting started

Run NPM install to install dependencies

# Purpose

This app will allow you to search for music recmmendations and have the ability to save bands that you are interested in to a favorites list for easy retrieval in the future. Each band returned also features song clips for quick and easy determining of interest in a band. I am also linking to e-stores where you can purchase each bands products if they are available.
